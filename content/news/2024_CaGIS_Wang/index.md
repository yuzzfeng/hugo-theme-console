### Abstract

Spatial knowledge, especially survey knowledge, plays a pivotal role in peopleâ€™s daily spatial tasks. However, the inherently limited visual perception and integration of spatial information often leads to inaccuracies in survey knowledge, with far-reaching consequences that affect performance, emotion, and safety in completing spatial tasks. In this study, we developed a mixed reality (MR)-based coordinate system and conducted a comparative user experiment involving 56 participants to explore whether perceiving metric and global spatial references during navigation may enhance the accuracy of user-acquired spatial knowledge. The experiment encompassed a spatial learning task where participants navigated and learned the selected indoor environment, followed by a desktop-based landmark recalling task to evaluate the accuracy of participantsâ€™ acquired survey knowledge. The results revealed the following insights: (1) the use of MR-based coordinate system significantly improved egocentric and allocentric spatial relations in participantsâ€™ survey knowledge; (2) participantsâ€™ errors in spatial relations among landmarks accumulate over distance, whereas the MR-based coordinate system helps maintain the errors at a consistent level; (3) no significant correlations were found between errors in participantsâ€™ survey knowledge and environmental familiarity, suggesting that the aiding effect of the MR-based coordinate system was independent of usersâ€™ prior knowledge of the environment; (4) participants reported increased mental demand using the MR-based coordinate system, but this did not result in diminished spatial learning performance or additional time pressure and learning efforts. These empirical results contribute to the future study of spatial knowledge acquisition and the design of spatial learning interfaces in mixed reality.
